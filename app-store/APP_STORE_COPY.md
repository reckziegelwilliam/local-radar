## App Store Review Information

### Notes for Review
This app facilitates discovery of local, community-driven micro-events. All events are user-generated and automatically expire after their end time. The app includes content moderation features where users can report inappropriate content, and events with 3 or more reports are automatically hidden. We review all reported content within 48 hours.

The app requires location services to show nearby events and enable users to create events at their current location. Location data is not stored permanently and is used only for real-time proximity queries.
