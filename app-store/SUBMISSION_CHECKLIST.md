This app facilitates discovery of local, community-driven micro-events. 
All events are user-generated and automatically expire after their end time.

Location services are required to:
- Show nearby events within 5km radius
- Enable users to create events at their current location

Location data is not stored permanently and is used only for real-time 
proximity queries.

For demo: Allow location permissions when prompted, and view the main map. 
Tap the "+" button to create a test event. Tap any event pin to view 
details and RSVP.
