## Adding Text Overlays (Recommended)

Text overlays help users understand features at a glance. Add them using Figma, Photoshop, or online tools.

### Suggested Overlay Text:

1. **Map View**: 
   - "Discover events near you"
   - "Real-time hyperlocal event map"

2. **Event Details**:
   - "RSVP and get directions"
   - "See what's happening"

3. **Create Event**:
   - "Post in under 20 seconds"
   - "Share what's happening"

4. **Categories**:
   - "8 smart categories"
   - "Find exactly what you want"

### Text Overlay Best Practices:
- Use your brand colors (check app theme)
- Keep text short and punchy
- Use sans-serif fonts (Helvetica, SF Pro, Roboto)
- Ensure high contrast for readability
- Position text in safe areas (not over critical UI)

## Styling Tips

### Device Frames
**Don't add device frames yourself!** The App Store and Play Store automatically add them.

### Background Status Bar
- Make sure status bar looks clean
- Set time to something like "9:41 AM" (iOS standard)
- Full battery and signal
- Consider using: `npx expo-status-bar-override` package

### Sample Data Quality
- Use realistic but appealing data
- Avoid lorem ipsum or placeholder text
- Use diverse emoji and categories
- Include reasonable RSVP counts (3-15 people)
- Show varied event times and durations

### Consistency
- Use the same style across all screenshots
- If you add device frames (for website), use same model
- If you add text overlays, use same font and colors
- Show similar zoom level on map views
